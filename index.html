<p>Who loves virtual pets? Umm. You do. That's who. That's why you're here -- to produce your own artificially intelligent super pet! Well, let us not get too ahead of ourselves. Would you settle for a friendly rhino, giraffe, monkey, or other creation? If so, you're in luck.</p>

<p>Because not only will you be able to feed and care for your digital creation, you'll learn something even more amazing: how to create one! We'll be using Meteor, which is a super awesome way to make apps, and this might be your first app ever! It's really easy to get started. And if you make some improvements, at the end you can even make this project even better by sharing your improvements with everyone!</p>

<p>Are you ready? Here we go, young programmer.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an account at nitrous.io. This is easy. Click over to nitrous.io and click sign up. Nitrous is great because it lets us do all our application development in a computer that lives "in the cloud" -- which is just a fancy way of saying, it's a computer we can access via our web browser, no matter where we are.

<ul>
<li>Once you're logged in, make a new node.js box. <a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/gj0cf1Ssy">Here is a quick video</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once your box is created, you'll need to install Meteor and then create the directory that holds your first app.

<ul>
<li>Type (1) <code>parts install meteor</code> in the console, then (2) <code>cd workspace</code> and (3) <code>meteor create myawesomepet</code> and you're all done. <a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/R0vqwnujtW">Here is a quick video</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next, you'll need to install a program called atmosphere. Don't worry about all the details, just follow the below:

<ul>
<li>Type <code>npm install -g meteorite</code> in the command line, then <code>cd myawesomepet</code>, then <code>mrt add meteorpets</code> <a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/C1aYcJt70jqo">Here is a quick video</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><p>Woah. You made it! Your computer in the cloud is ready!</p>
